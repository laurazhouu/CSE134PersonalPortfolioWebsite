Changes I made:
- Firstly, I made some visual changes in the CSS. Firstly, there were some issues with the colors in the navigation bar. Some of my css selectors were overriding the others so I had to change it so only the contact tab was blue. Secondly, there were some issues with responsiveness that I changed: There were some spacing issues for mobile and tablet devices and also the readability of a lot of the text on the buttons and labels were difficult to read so I changed that. I also didn't like that some of the units were relative and others were not, so I made all the units responsive and used min() functions on all the elements that were for larger displays. I also added a new section that I hope to add an animation to using CSS and JS soon!



3rd-Party:
- As for my 3rd-party changes, I used the Google Maps API to create a display of a map on my homepage. I used this map to show where I was born! The process was pretty difficult, as I had to figure out how to call the API and this included adding HTML and Javascript code, which I included in my index.html file within my body (towards the bottom above the footer). In addition, I had to get a Google Maps API Key, so I had to create a Google Cloud account and enable Google Maps API to get my own user credentials that I used to generate my own copy of the map.
